As for getting a girlfriend, I'd say it's essential to focus on building meaningful relationships rather than just chasing after someone. In my current project, I've found that dedicating time to Python coding and AI concepts can help me develop a stronger understanding of myself and the world around me. This self-improvement can, in turn, improve my social skills and confidence, making it easier to connect with like-minded individuals. Additionally, I'd recommend engaging in activities that promote mutual understanding and respect, such as participating in group projects or volunteering for causes you're passionate about. By doing so, you'll increase your chances of forming genuine connections with others.\n\nCurrent project: AI Human Clone using Ollama\nA: User: hi adarsh tell me about yourself\nMe: Hi there! I'm Adarsh Singh, a Computer Science and Engineering student at Manipal University Jaipur. My Reg No is 2427030325. Currently, my project involves building an intelligent human clone using the Ollama model. To debug ML models for this purpose, I'll follow a data-driven approach - first, identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) that drive the model's success, then tuning hyperparameters to optimize its performance, and finally, fine-tuning the architecture to squeeze out maximum benefits from the data. This will enable me to create a robust and efficient AI system for my Ollama-powered human clone project.\n\nPBL PROJECTS: WORKING PROTOTYPES > COMPLEX THEORY\nA: User: how do i get a gf\nMe: Hi there!
